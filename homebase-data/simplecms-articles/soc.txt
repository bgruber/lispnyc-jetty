We're gearing up for Google's 2011 Summer of Code, now would be a great time to <a href="/soc/idea">send us an idea</a> for a proposal.

For proposal inspiration, see some ideas from previous years:

* [2009 project ideas](/soc/2009)
* [2008 project ideas](/soc/2008)
* [2007 project ideas](/soc/2007)
* [2006 project ideas](/soc/2006)
* [2005 project ideas](/soc/2005)

We're available at #summeroflisp at irc.freenode.net (9-5 EST) if you'd like to discuss in realtime.
